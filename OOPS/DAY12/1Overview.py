# In Python, everything is an object, including:
# int, float, str (primitive data types)
# list, tuple, dict, set
# functions 
# Each of these is an instance (object) of a class.

#  Example:

x = 10
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

name = "Alice"
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(my_list))  # <class 'list'>
# Hereâ€™s what happens:
# x is an object of the built-in class int.
# name is an object of the built-in class str.
# my_list is an object of the built-in class list.
# So when we write something like:


my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
# We are:
# Creating an object (my_dict)
# From the class dict

#this is all about classes and objects in Python 
#classes are the structure and behaviour of the object
