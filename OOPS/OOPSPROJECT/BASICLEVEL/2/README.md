# Student Information Management System (OOP-Based Project)

##  Overview

This project is a basic console-based Student Information Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. It allows users to input multiple student records, display them, and store them in a dictionary for quick access.

##  Features

- Accepts student details: Name, Age, and Roll Number.
- Displays student information immediately after input.
- Stores each student's details in a dictionary using their name as the key.
- Repeats the process based on user input.


## Concepts Demonstrated

- Class and Object Creation
- Instance Variables
- Methods
- Dictionary Manipulation
- Input/Output Operations
- Looping and Conditional Logic

##  Class Design
